          <p>
            I have worked in multiple cross-functional teams consisting of developers, testers, product owners, and UX designers, with agile working methods. I have taken on a variety of responsibilities including addressing backlog issues, contributing to existing services, and developing and designing new systems using modern Java event-driven microservices with technologies such as Spring Boot and Google Cloud Platform. I have also participated in stand-ups, retros, and sprint planning, and have successfully onboarded multiple interns to the company.

          <p>
            I'm a part of the Backend team at G-Loot and I'm primarily working on new initiatives but also taking on tasks in different parts of the Backend. I'm also managing a team of Backend interns, spreading my knowledge by helping them technically and leading standups, and sprint plannings. I'm also a supervisor for some of the interns and report to their school/university.
