# Cloud Resume

This repository is my solution for the [The Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/). It showcases my skills in building a cloud-based resume using various AWS technologies. The project includes a diagram illustrating the architecture of the resume.
